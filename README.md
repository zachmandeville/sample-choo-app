# sample-choo-app

This is really just a collection of notes.  I wanted to understand the basic architecture of a choo app better,
so I made one using create-choo-app, then I commented on each critical part of the code.

The comments I left are on store/clicks.js views/main.js and index.js.

If I got any part of this wrong, or am fundamentally misunderstanding it, please lemme know thru a pull request (if you'd like!)
